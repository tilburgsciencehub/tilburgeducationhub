[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6d830f7a-c690-4968-bf68-c09ed45e54f9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tilburgeducationhub/deploys)

Tilburg Education Hub (TEH) is an online catalogue of open education classes and materials developed at Tilburg University. It's a hub for students where they can find all the openly shared courses.

## Why was TEH developed?
Many colleagues have started developing open education materials, but there is still no single catalogue that students can use to easily access them. This is just an experiment, a sister project of [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com).
