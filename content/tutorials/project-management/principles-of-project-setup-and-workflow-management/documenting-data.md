## Documenting Datasets

If your project contains data that has been newly created (i.e., which is not otherwise (publicly) available yet; including *derived* data sets), you are required to include a documentation of that data in your project.

Instances of "new data" may included, but are not restricted to be:

* data scraped from websites
* data gathered via APIs
* manually labeled data
	* e.g., to assign GDP per capita to a list of countries
	* e.g., to classify a music label as a major versus independent label
	* ...
* data *derived* from secondary data (e.g., a cleaned data set; making explicit how you cleaned the data is important for future use of that data)

Think of "new data" as *any* data that feeds into one of the pipeline stages in your project; it really needs not to be "big" data, but can simply consist of a `.csv` file with
names and associated labels (e.g., as in the case of countries --> GDP per capita).
