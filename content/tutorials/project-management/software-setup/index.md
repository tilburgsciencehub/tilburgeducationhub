These pages should help you to get started setting up the computing environment on your machine ready.

Think your machine is already configured well? Then [directly proceed to our tutorial on setting up efficient workflows to manage data- and computation-intensive projects](/tutorials/reproducible-research/implement-an-efficient-and-reproducible-workflow/implement-an-efficient-and-reproducible-workflow-overview/). If necessary, you can come back to this section to make changes to your computer's configuration.

## Configure your computer
Of course, there are many ways to set up a machine, and we do not mean to consider our way of doing to be perfect. In fact, the setup instructions sometimes resemble a compromise, so that later instructions - given to both Windows, Mac and Linux users - can be followed as closely as possible.

**If you are writing your Master thesis at Tilburg University, please attempt to install necessary software and packages prior to your first meeting.**
