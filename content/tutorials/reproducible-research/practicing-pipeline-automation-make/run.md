## Let's run the workflow

When starting to work with a template, we ideally like to see it "working" on "test data" first. In this way, we know we can extend it easily. As our template is fully automated, building should be easy - you only need to type `make`.

So let's go ahead by first watching our demo on what happens if you run `make` in our template's main directory. Then, you can proceed to our practice questions.

### Practice questions and answers

1) If you haven't done so yet, open Anaconda prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac) in the template's main directory, and type `make`. What happens?

2) Now, let's type `make` again. What happens now?!

3) Compare the directory/file structure with how it looked like before running `make`. What are the differences?

4) Can you reconstruct what has just happened when running `make`, by looking at the `makefile` in the main directory? Imagine you're arriving at the crime scene, and all you see is that file. Be a detective and start your investigation!
