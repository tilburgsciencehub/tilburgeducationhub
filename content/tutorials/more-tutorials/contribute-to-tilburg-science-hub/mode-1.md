## The Easiest Possible Way

Maybe you don't want to have to deal with GitHub - or you don't have the time for that.
Or maybe you hate formatting Markdown files, or you don't know on what category on our website your new article should fit in.

No worries, you can still contribute to Tilburg Science Hub! It's as easy as sending an email.

You can send us your corrections or new material at **[tsh [at] tilburguniversity [dot] edu](mailto:tsh@tilburguniversity.edu)**.
