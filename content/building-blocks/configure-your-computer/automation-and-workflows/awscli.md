Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cloud-computing and storage facilities that can be used for research projects. To make optimal use of AWS, you can control AWS resources (e.g., starting computers, downloading data) using a so-called command-line interface.

The AWS command-line interface is a light-weight tool that provides you with a "remote control" to the AWS cloud.

Here, we show you how to install and configure AWS CLI.

## Step 1: Install AWS CLI

- Install AWS client by following the [installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html) provided by Amazon

Note: here, we install AWS CLI version 1, not version 2 (required for backwards-compatibility for some of the projects run by Tilburg Science Hub).

## Step 2: Configure AWS client

- Open a new terminal / command line window
- Type: `aws configure`
- Enter your login credentials for AWS. Typically, these are provided to you by your research institution or team member.
