## Installing Command Line Tools

A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as a terminal, is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).

Throughout the course we will emphasize use of the terminal and executing commands within it as our modus operandi.

### Windows Users

So that we can work as closely as possible to the Mac and Linux users we will install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

*   Download Cygwin [here](https://cygwin.com/install.html) and use the graphical installer. Accept all the default options.
*   Choose any server from which to download cygwin and packages when prompted.
*   Verify your installation by opening Cygwin. When it opens you should see a black box with some text that looks like:

```bash
userName@computerName: ~$
```
<!--i.e. for Uli he sees:
```bash
ubergmann@dhcp-wlan-uzh-10-12-130-xxx: ~$
```

We will explain what all this means in the first day or so of the course.

Why Cygwin?
* We will uses Cygwin as our command line tool, and unlike other Windows shells such as PowerShell it uses Unix syntax.
*  Anywhere throughout the remainder of the installation guide where we suggest you to enter a command into a terminal, enter the text-based command into your Cygwin terminal followed by pressing `Return`, for example:

        userName@computerName: ~$ whoami

Should return your username.

**Do not delete the setup-x86_64.exe file.** It needs to be kept so that we can add on some additional packages to use in the course.

### Mac Users

A command line interface comes already installed with MacOS.

You will need to install some other software from the terminal thoughout the course, so it will be useful to install some additional "command line tools" now:

*   First we want to install X-code command line tools. Open a terminal by searching for it with spotlight, `cmd + spacebar` then type terminal and press `Return` when it appears. Then, copy and paste the following

```
xcode-select --install
```

If you get an answer that the command line tools are already installed, you can just continue to the next step.

* Second, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by opening a terminal and pasting the following command:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

* To verify that Homebrew installed correctly, enter the following into your terminal
```
brew doctor
```
And you should see the following output
```
Your system is ready to brew
```

* Now we can use Homebrew to easily install software. To use the current R version 3.5.1, we want to make sure you have some basic system tools that some packages require. Let's (re)install them real quick. First `libxml2`:

```
brew reinstall libxml2
```

If you system tells you that it is not yet installed, then try  ```brew install libxml2``` instead.

We also want to link this so that terminal finds it later:

```
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

* Second, we also need `openssl`:

```
brew reinstall openssl
```
Again, if it is already installed, then use ``` brew install openssl``` instead.

Again, we need it to link to terminal:

```
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```



* Finally, we need `libgit2`:

```
brew install libgit2
```

If terminal tells you it is not yet installed, then go for ```brew reinstall libgit2```

### Linux Users

To use the current R version, we need to install some system tools. For this open a terminal session with `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`.

* Now copy the following command into terminal and press `Enter`:

```
  sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev librtmp-dev
```

* After the installation succeeded successfully repeat this one-by-one with the following two other commands:

```
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```
