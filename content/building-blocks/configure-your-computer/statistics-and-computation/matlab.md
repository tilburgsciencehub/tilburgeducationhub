## Installing MATLAB

MATLAB is a high-level programming language and an environment for numerical computation and visualization.

The University of Zurich has a campus-wide MATLAB license available to all students and employees.
We will use this license to activate MATLAB on our machine.

If you study or work at Tilburg University and you do not have MATLAB installed on your machine, please register via [Mathworks](https://nl.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/tilburg-university-30348529.html) and follow the [installation instructions](https://servicedesk.uvt.nl/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=9c895a61-020c-4692-92a7-96ef357211f7) available on the IT Self-Service Portal.
