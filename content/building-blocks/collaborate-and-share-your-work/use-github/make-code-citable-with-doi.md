DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) are a very important and widely used tool to uniquely identify objects in academic literature and beyond - for instance, journal articles, research reports, but also code and data sets.

If you are a researcher who writes code and deals with primary data, you may want to archive your code and make it citable by assigning a DOI to your GitHub repository.

Follow [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) and learn how to do it using GitHub and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/about).
