## Overview

In this example, you find a simple `make` pipeline, which prepares (`data-preparation`) and analyzes (`analysis`) data using R, and creates some tables for a paper (`paper`) using LaTeX.

This is probably the most simplistic but still complete workflow, and thus highly recommended as a template to kickstart your projects.

You can check out [this repository](https://github.com/rgreminger/example-make-workflow) for all the details. Fork it/use it as a template - contributions appreciated!
