## Overview

The **[Data Mining for Business and Governance](https://datamining.tilburgsciencehub.com)** course is an open-source Master level course taught at Tilburg University. All of its content is freely available and consists of lectures, live streams, self-study material, tutorials and examples.

This course teaches you to process, analyse data, and make predictions based on the patterns in the data. You will deal with three main topics: data, algorithms, and evaluation. For a more in-depth introduction, you can read the syllabus [here](https://datamining.tilburgsciencehub.com/docs/syllabus/).

And of course, throughout the course, weâ€™ll be using the workflow principles of reproducible science that we advocate at [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com).
