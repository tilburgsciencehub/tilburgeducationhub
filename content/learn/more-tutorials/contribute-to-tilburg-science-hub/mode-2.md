## There's a Better Way

Like in [the first method](../mode-1), you can reach out to us with any request by opening an issue on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/website). We prefer this method because it allow us to keep track of bugs and requests more easily, to merge duplicates, assign roles, etc...

### How to create an issue on GitHub

It's very easy!

1. First, navigate to **[our GitHub repository](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/website)**.

2. Click "**Issues**" under the repository name.

4. Click "**Get started**" next to the type of issue that you'd like to open.

6. When you're done, click "**Submit new issue**".
