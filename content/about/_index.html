				<h1 class="mb-4">About Tilburg Education Hub</h1>
				<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
				<p class="text-secondary">Tilburg Education Hub (TEH) is an online catalogue of open education classes and materials developed at Tilburg University. It's a hub for students where they can find all the openly shared courses.</p>

				<h3 id="why-was-teh-developed">Why was TEH developed?</h3>
				<p class="text-secondary">Many colleagues have started developing open education materials, but there is still no single catalogue that students can use to easily access them. This is just an experiment, a sister project of <a href="https://tilburgsciencehub.com">Tilburg Science Hub</a>. If you have any feedback, question or suggestion, feel free to contact us!</p>

				<!-- <h3 id="what-does-tsh-offer">What does TSH offer?</h3>
				<p>Many of us face the same dilemma. We know that a small investment will have big returns, but we put off making it because we lack the time to make it now. TSH makes it easier to make this investment now by providing:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>information about all one needs to know to get started</li>
					<li>tutorials</li>
					<li>example workflows</li>
					<li>starter code</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This makes it much more attractive and fun to start now, because the initial investment becomes even smaller.</p>

				<h3 id="who-is-tsh-for">Who is TSH for?</h3>
				<p>First, (research master and PhD) <b>students</b> will be able to quickly become operational and learn not only about how to properly code a specific algorithm but also how to address specific marketing-related problems.</p>

				<p>Second, <b>academics</b> will be able to (1) reproduce published work in a more efficient way and (2) identify codes that might be useful for them and appropriately use them and (3) potentially become contributors to the repository at little cost.</p>

				<p>Third, <b>companies</b> interested in marketing analytics will be able to get efficient training to state-of-the-art marketing analytics tools (published in top marketing journals), and access to code which they could understand and adapt to their own situation.</p> -->

				<h3 id="who-maintains-teh">Who maintains TEH?</h3>
				<p>TEH is part of a bigger, open-source project called Tilburg Science Hub. Its development has been financially supported by <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management">Tilburg School of Economics and Management (2019-...).</a></p>

				<p>The site is managed by <a href="https://www.hannesdatta.com">Hannes Datta</a> and <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/t-j-klein">Tobias Klein</a>. Some material is based on the fantastic (open source) works of others - see below.</p>

				<p>Do you want to contribute to TEH or your open education class to be featured? Contact us below!
