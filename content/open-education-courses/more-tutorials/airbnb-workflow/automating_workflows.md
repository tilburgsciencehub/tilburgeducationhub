# Automating Workflows

Up to this point, you should have created the following five R scripts:

{{% summary %}}  

| File | Description | Phase |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| `download.R` | Downloads the data from Inside Airbnb and stores as csv format | Input |
| `clean.R` | Preprocesses the raw data into an aggregated format ready for analysis and visualisation  | Transformation |
| `pivot_table.R` | Create a pivot table for the number of reviews by region across time | Transformation |
| `plot_all.R` | Create a line chart for the total number of reviews in a city across time | Output |
| `plot_Amsterdam.R` | Create a line chart for the number of reviews for the top 3 neighborhoods in Amsterdam | Output |

{{% /summary %}}




As you've worked through the set of exercises, you've repeatedly built on preliminary results. For example, the plot for the top 3 cities in Amsterdam (`plot_Amsterdam.pdf`) could only be created once the `pivot_table.csv` file had been generated. In a similar way, the preprocessing pipeline (`clean.R`) could only take place once the data (`listings.csv` & `reviews.csv`) had been downloaded. These dependencies have been depicted in the figure below.

Revisit the [study notes](/automate/project-setup) on *"Automating your Pipeline"* and write a `makefile` that captures the end-to-end process (from `download.R` to `plot_all.pdf` & `plot_Amsterdam.pdf`). Also, add an `all` and `clean` phony target.


**Exercise**     
Swap the `url_listings` and `url_reviews` for a historical dataset of Amsterdam from the year 2016 (gather the links from the "[show archived page](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)"). Run `make` again in the root directory.


Do the same for a recent Airbnb dataset from New York.  If done correctly, it should not take more than a minute (power to automation!). Do your workflows still run as expected? How about the `plot_Amsterdam.R` file? Why is that?
