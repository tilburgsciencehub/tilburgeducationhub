## Motivation

When working on a project, most of us spend time thinking about *what* to create (e.g., a cleaned data set, a new algorithm, an analysis, and/or a paper and corresponding slides), but not about how to *manage* its creation. This results in two major issues, as outlined next.

**Major issues in managing data-intensive projects**

- we may lose sight of the project ("directory and file chaos")

  - Gradually, we write code and edit data sets, and put those files somewhere on our computer.
  - When we update files, we either overwrite them, or save new versions under different file names (e.g., including dates like `20191126_mycode.R` or version numbers like `mycode_v2.R`).
  - Even with *best intentions to keep everything tidy*, months or years of working on a project will very likely result in chaos.

- we may find it difficult to (re)execute the project ("lack of automation")
  - The way you have set up your project may make it cumbersome to execute the project. Which code files to run, which not? How long does it take for a code file to complete running?
  - For example, you wish to re-do your analysis on a small subset of the data (either for prototyping, or as a robustness check), or you would like to try out new variables or test whether a new package provides speed gains...
  - However, re-running your project takes a lot of time - if at all you remember how to "run" the various code files you have written.

The primary mission of **managing data- and computation-intensive projects** is to build a transparent project infrastructure, that allows for easily (re)executing your code potentially many times.

## Guiding Principles

The objectives of this tutorial are:

- learn how to organize and track the evolution of your projects (e.g., by means of a proper [directory structure](../directories), and [code versioning](../versioning))
- learn how to automize your workflows, and make them reproducible (e.g., by using [automation](../automation))
- learn how to [work on projects with others](../collaboration) (e.g., by means of Git/GitHub)
- learn how to [document datasets](../documenting-data) and [workflows](../documenting-code)
- learn how to write clean code (e.g., see our [Building Blocks](/building-blocks))

## Gradual Implementation

{{% tip %}}
**Gradually implement our suggestions.**

* We may sometimes sound a bit dogmatic (e.g., you must do this or that). Some of our instructions will only make sense to you after a while. So, please stick with our recommendations during the course of your first few projects. Later on, take the liberty to re-design the workflows to your needs.
* Consider adopting our suggestions **gradually**.
  1. Start with a proper [directory structure on your local computer](../directories/#data-management-for-each-of-the-projects-components), which
  may already be sufficient to start collaborating. For example,
  do you need feedback from your advisor? Just zip (the relevant parts of) your pipeline
  and use [SURF's filesending service (for researchers affiliated with Dutch institutions)](https://filesender.surf.nl/) to send it!
  2. Start [automating](../automation) (parts of) your pipeline
  3. Document your [project](../documenting-code) and [raw data](../documenting-data)
  4. Start to [track changes to your source code](../versioning), and [clean up your source/"do your housekeeping"](../checklist) regularly

**Uhh, you just suggested to send an email, really?!**
- Indeed, email is not what we want to advocate.
- But then again, we want you to get started with managing your workflows right away, and adhering to the directory structure outlined above already increases your efficiency.
- So, before you proceed to the future chapters of this guide, sit back, and relax, and keep on using good old email.

## Configure your Computer

Think your machine is already configured well? Then proceed directly to the next page.

**Configure your computer**.
- Note that to implement our workflow suggestions, your computer needs to be configured properly - so we [suggest you to do that first](/building-blocks/configure-your-computer).
- Of course, you need not to install all software tools - but pick *at least* your statistical software package (e.g., [we use R](/get/r/), but others prefer [Stata](/get/stata/)), [Python](/get/python/), and [`make`](/get/make/).

Of course, there are many ways to set up a machine, and we do not mean to consider our way of doing to be perfect. In fact, the setup instructions sometimes resemble a compromise, so that later instructions - given to both Windows, Mac and Linux users - can be followed as closely as possible.

**If you are writing your Master thesis at Tilburg University, please attempt to install necessary software and packages prior to your first meeting.**

* If everything goes smoothly, you should be able to complete the installation in one sitting within 60-120 minutes.
* Please follow the steps one-by-one in the order they appear on the side bar and do not deviate from them, unless you really know what you are doing.
* Where necessary, we have provided instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux machines.
