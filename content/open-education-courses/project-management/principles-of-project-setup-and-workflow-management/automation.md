## Overview

Remember the [different stages of a project's pipeline](../pipeline/#project-pipelines)? Let's suppose
we're in the process of preparing our data set for analysis. For example:

1. You wish to convert three raw data sets from Excel to CSV files.
2. You want to merge these three CSV files and apply some cleaning steps.
3. Finally, you want to save the final data set, so that it can be used in
other stages of your project pipeline (e.g., such as the analysis).

This workflow for your specific pipeline can be visualized as follows:

![Workflow](../make_flowchart.png)

Using so-called "build tools" such as [`make`](/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/automation-and-workflows/make/), we can specify:

- what code runs and when, and
- what inputs (e.g., data, parameters) a given source code file needs to run.

Specifically, `make` introduces "recipes" that are used to tell `make` how to
build certain `targets`, using a set of `source files` and `execution command(s)`.

- A *target* refers to **what** needs to be built (e.g., a file),
- *source(s)* specify what is **required** to execute the build, and
- the *execution command* specifies **how** to execute the build.

In `make` code, this becomes:

```make
target: source(s)
    execution command
```
## Translating the Pipeline into "Recipes" for `make`

In "`make` code," the workflow above - saved in a *makefile* (a file called `makefile`, without a file type ending) - becomes:

```make

../../gen/data-preparation/temp/cleaned_data1.csv ../../gen/data-preparation/temp/cleaned_data2.csv ../../gen/data-preparation/temp/cleaned_data3.csv: ../../data/dataset1/raw_data1.xlsx ../../data/dataset2/raw_data2.xlsx ../../data/dataset3/raw_data3.xlsx python to_csv.py
   	python to_csv.py

../../gen/data-preparation/temp/merged.csv: ../../gen/data-preparation/temp/cleaned_data1.csv ../../gen/data-preparation/temp/cleaned_data2.csv ../../gen/data-preparation/temp/cleaned_data3.csv merge.R
   	R --vanilla --args "" < "merge.R"
```

<!--
../temp/analysis.RData: ../temp/merged.csv analyze.R
   	R --vanilla --args "" < "analyze.R"

../temp/plot.png: ../temp/merged.csv plot.R
   	R --vanilla --args "" < "plot.R"

../output/report.pdf: ../temp/plot.png ../temp/analysis.RData
	R -e "rmarkdown::render('make_report.Rmd', output_file = '../output/report.pdf')"
-->

Pay attention to the subdirectory structure used here: the rules refer to files in different folders (src, gen, data, etc.), which are explained [earlier in this guide](../directories).

## Running `make`

### Building your pipeline / running `make`

You run the entire workflow by typing `make` in the directory where the `makefile` is located.

### Preview your pipeline, "dry run"

If you type `make -n`, you are entering a sort-of "preview" mode: `make`
will provide you a list of commands it would execute - but it does not
actually execute them. Great to preview how a workflow would be executed!

### Consider Source Code or Targets as Up-to-Date

By default, `make` runs each step in a workflow that *needs* to be
updated. However, sometimes you wish to only rebuild *some* but not all
parts of your project. For example, consider the case where you have only
added some comments to some R scripts, but re-running that part of the project
would not change any of the resulting output files (e.g., let's say a dataset).

There are two ways in which you can "skip" the re-builds, depending on
whether you want to consider **file(s)**, or **targets** as up-to-date.
Recall that *targets* are higher-order recipes, whereas files are, well,
merely files.

**Considering a *target* as up-to-date:**

Pass the parameter `-t targetname` to `make`, and press enter. For example,
```
make -t targetname
```

The `targetname` is now "up-to-date". When you then run `make`,
it will only run those files necessary to build the remainder of the workflow.

**Considering *source code* as up-to-date:**

Pass the parameter `-o filename1 filename2` to `make`.
In other words, `filename1` and `filename2` will be considered "infinitely old",
and when rebuilding, that part of the project will not be executed.

{{% warning %}}
Of course, using `-t` and `-o` should only be used for *prototyping* your
code. When you're done editing (e.g., at the end of the day), make
your temporary and output files, and re-run `make`
to see whether everything works (and reproduces).

### Advanced use cases

This [book by O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/make3/book/index.csp) explains all the bells and whistles about using `make`. Definitely recommended!

## Miscellaneous

### Why is `make` useful?

- You may have a script that takes a very long time to build a dataset
(let's say a couple of hours), and another script that runs an analysis on it.
You only would like to produce a new dataset if actually code to make that dataset has changed.
Using `make`, your computer will figure out what code to execute to get you your final analysis.

- You may want to run a robustness check on a larger sample, using a virtual computer you have rented in the cloud.
To run your analysis, you would have to spend hours of executing script after script to make sure the project runs the way you want.
Using `make `, you can simply ship your entire code off to the cluster, change the sample size, and wait for the job to be done.

### Are there alternatives to `make`?

#### Other build tools

There are dozens of build tools in the market, many of which are open source. For more information, please check [Awesome Pipeline](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline) and [Awesome Workflow](https://github.com/meirwah/awesome-workflow-engines).

#### Readme.txt

Don't have time to set up a reproducible workflow using `make`?
A `readme.txt` - or, in other words, a plain text file with some documentation - is great alternative.
They are very useful to provide an overview about what the project is
about, and many researchers also use them to explain in which order to run scripts. But then again,
you would have to execute that code manually.

#### make.bat - A bash Script

What you see with other researchers is that they put the running instructions into a bash script,
for example a `.bat` file on Windows. Such a file is helpful because it makes the order of
execution *explicit*. The downside is that such a file will always build *everything* - even those
targets that are already up-to-date. Especially in data- and computation-intensive
projects, though, you would exactly want to avoid that to make quick progress.

To sum up, we prefer `make` over a `readme.txt` or a `make.bat`. But better have one of those than no documentation at all.

{{% summary %}}
**What is `make`, and how can we use it to automate pipelines?**

With `make`, we:

- explicitly document the workflow, making communication with colleagues (and especially our future selves) more efficient,

- can reproduce the entire workflow with one command,

- keep track of complicated file dependencies, and

- are kept from *repeating* typos or mistakes - if we stick to using `make` everytime
we want to run our project, then we *must* correct each mistake before we can continue.
